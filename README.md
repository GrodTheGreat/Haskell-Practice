# Haskell Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Haskell

## Projects
### Project 1: Calculator
**Overview:** Create a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Skills:** Basic syntax, arithmetic operations, input/output handling.

### Project 2: To-Do List
**Overview:** Build a to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Data should persist between sessions.

**Skills:** Data structures (lists), functions, basic file I/O.

### Project 3: Hangman Game
**Overview:** Implement the classic Hangman game. The program should select a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess letters until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.

**Skills:** Randomization, strings, input validation.

### Project 4: File Encryption/Decryption
**Overview:** Create a program that can encrypt and decrypt text files using a simple encryption algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher).

**Skills:** String manipulation, file I/O, basic encryption techniques.

### Project 5: Web Scraper
**Overview:** Build a web scraper that extracts information from a website (e.g., news headlines, weather data) and presents it in a structured format.

**Skills:** HTTP requests, parsing HTML/XML, regular expressions.

### Project 6: Basic Database Management System
**Overview:** Develop a simple database management system (DBMS) that allows users to create, read, update, and delete records in a text-based database.

**Skills:** Data modeling, file/database management, CRUD operations.

### Project 7: RESTful API
**Overview:** Design and implement a RESTful API for a simple application (e.g., a blog, a todo list). Include endpoints for CRUD operations.

**Skills:** Web development basics, routing, handling HTTP methods.

### Project 8: Chatbot
**Overview:** Create a chatbot that can hold a conversation with users, responding to queries and providing information based on predefined rules or patterns.

**Skills:** Natural language processing, pattern matching, state management.

### Project 9: Image Processing
**Overview:** Build a program that can perform basic image processing tasks like resizing, cropping, and applying filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia).

**Skills:** Working with binary data, image processing algorithms.

### Project 10: Machine Learning Model
**Overview:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) to make predictions based on a dataset.

**Skills:** Data manipulation, understanding of machine learning concepts, libraries like `hmatrix` for numerical computations.
